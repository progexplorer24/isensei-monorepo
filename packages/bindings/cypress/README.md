# Cypress Bindings

The goal of this project was to enable Rescript users to write unit, integration & end-to-end tests.

At the time of writing there was no solution that enabled writing Cypress test with fully-typed API in Rescript ([Link to original repo](https://github.com/progexplorer24/rescript-monorepo/tree/master/src/bindings)).

## Alternatives 
Since then some community members created alternative implementation. Project seems to be actively maintained and is available on npm. I never used though. You can check it out and see wchich one you prefer - [Rescript Cypress](https://github.com/noble-ai/rescript-cypress).
