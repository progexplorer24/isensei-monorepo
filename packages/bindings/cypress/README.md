# Cypress Bindings

This project enables you to write Cypress tests in Rescript.

At the time of creating it there weren't any cypress bindings available ([Link to original repo](https://github.com/progexplorer24/rescript-monorepo/tree/master/src/bindings)). Things have changed now, and you can find cypress bindings on npm. See [Alternatives](##alternatives)

## Usage
I created hundreds of test examples. You can check them out here:
[**Cypress Test Examples**](https://github.com/progexplorer24/isensei-monorepo/tree/main/apps/cypress-examples/cypress/integration)

## Alternatives 
Other Rescript community members also shared their implementation. Project seems to be actively maintained and is available on npm. You can check it out and see which one you prefer - [Rescript Cypress](https://github.com/noble-ai/rescript-cypress).
