# Cypress Bindings

The goal of this project was to enable Rescript users to write unit, integration & end-to-end tests.

At the time of writing there was no solution that enabled writing Cypress test with fully-typed API in Rescript ([Link to original repo](https://github.com/progexplorer24/rescript-monorepo/tree/master/src/bindings)).

## Usage
I created hundreds of test examples. You can check them out here:
[**Cypress Test Examples**](https://github.com/progexplorer24/isensei-monorepo/tree/main/apps/cypress-examples/cypress/integration)

## Alternatives 
Since then some community members created alternative implementation. Project seems to be actively maintained and is available on npm. I never used though. You can check it out and see wchich one you prefer - [Rescript Cypress](https://github.com/noble-ai/rescript-cypress).
