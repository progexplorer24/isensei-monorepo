  "content": "iSensei was created in order to promote open software & education. We strongly believe in sharing knowledge and learning out in the open. We want to promote innovation and encourage research and development practices in learning. Because of the very centralized state model of Polish education, there's very little innovation happening. We believe that education should be the first frontier where new ideas and different perspectives are cherished, welcomed and explored."
