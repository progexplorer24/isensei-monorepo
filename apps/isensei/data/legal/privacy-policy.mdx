## 1. What Data We Get

We collect certain data from you directly, like information you enter yourself, data about your consumption of content, and data
from third-party platforms you connect with iSensei. We also collect some data automatically, like information about your device
and what parts of our Services you interact with or spend time using. All data listed in this section is subject to the following
processing activities: collecting, recording, structuring, storing, altering, retrieving, encrypting, pseudonymizing, erasing,
combining, and transmitting.

### 1.1 Data You Provide to Us

We may collect different data from or about you depending on how you use the Services. Below are some examples to help you better
understand the data we collect.

When you create an account and use the Services, including through a third-party platform, we collect any data you provide directly,
including:

**First Table**

The data listed above is stored by us and associated with your account.

### 1.2 Data We Collect through Automated Means

When you access the Services (including browsing content), we collect certain data by automated means, including:

**Second Table**

The data listed above is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies, as detailed in the
“Cookies and Data Collection Tools” section below. It is stored by us and associated with your account.

### 1.3 Data From Third Parties

If you are our enterprise or corporate prospect, in addition to information you submit to us, we may collect
certain business contact information from third-party commercial sources.

## 2. How We Get Data About You

We use tools like cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to gather the data listed above.
Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data collection.

### 2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools

We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to collect, store, and share data about your activities across
websites, including on iSensei. They allow us to remember things about your visits to iSensei, like your preferred language,
and to make the site easier to use. To learn more about cookies, visit [Cookiepedia](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies).
We may also use clear pixels in emails to track deliverability and open rates.

iSensei and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party advertisers) use server log files
and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons
(together, “Data Collection Tools“) when you access and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and
collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data
gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as described in this Privacy Policy.

### 2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools

iSensei uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:

- **Strictly Necessary:** These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the site, provide basic functionality (like logging in
  or accessing content), secure the site, protect against fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of
  your account. These are required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site will break or be
  unavailable.

- **Functional:** These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser and your preferences, provide additional
  site functionality, customize content to be more relevant to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior
  of the Services (like your preferred language or volume level for video playback).

- **Performance:** These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the Services by providing usage and performance data,
  visit counts, traffic sources, or where an application was downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions
  of iSensei to see which features or content users prefer and determine which email messages are opened.

- **Advertising:** These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver relevant ads (on the site and/or other sites) based on things
  we know about you like your Usage and System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that the ad service providers know about
  you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites
  and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version
  of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.

- **Social Media:** These Data Collection Tools enable social media functionality, like sharing content with friends and networks.
  These cookies may track a user or device across other sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted advertising purposes.

You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer, limit the types of cookies you allow,
or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some or all features of the Services, and your experience may
be different or less functional. To learn more about managing Data Collection Tools, refer to Section
6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below.

## 4. Who We Share Your Data With

We share certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, iSensei affiliates,
our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run
promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services. We may also share your data as needed
for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is
aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent.

We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:

- **With Your Instructors:** We share data that we have about you (except your email address) with instructors or
  teaching assistants for educational content you access or request information about, so they can improve their content for you
  and other students. This data may include things like your country, browser language, operating system, device settings,
  the site that brought you to iSensei, and certain activities on iSensei, like enrolled courses and course review. We will not
  share your email address with instructors or teaching assistants. (Account Data; System Data; Usage Data; Approximate Geographic Data)

  viewable, including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant,

  data enrichment services, we share certain contact information or de-identified data. De-identified data means data where
  we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to
  provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information
  (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective
  and customized manner. (Account Data; System Data; Usage Data; Cookie Data)

- **To Power Social Media Features:** The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the
  third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to

  System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among

## 5. Security

We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there
is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any
unauthorized access to your account.

iSensei takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of
your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately,
however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and iSensei, the Services, or any
information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by
third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should
not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change
it immediately and contact our [Support Team](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com) with any concerns.

## 6. Your Rights

You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection
of your data by certain third parties. You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us
for individual rights requests about your personal data. Parents who believe we’ve unintentionally collected personal data about
their underage child should contact us for help deleting that information.

### 6.1 Your Choices About the Use of Your Data

You can choose not to provide certain data to us, but you may not be able to use certain features of the Services.

  Services, including administrative confirmations, order confirmations, important updates about the Services, and notices about our
  policies.

- If you’re located in the European Economic Area, you may opt out of certain Data Collection Tools by clicking the
  “Cookie settings“ link at the bottom of any page or contact our [Support Team](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com).

- The browser or device you use may allow you to control cookies and other types of local data storage. To learn more about managing
  cookies, visit [Cookiepedia](https://cookiepedia.co.uk/how-to-manage-cookies). Your wireless device may also allow you to control
  whether location or other data is collected and shared.

- To opt out of allowing Google Analytics to use your data for analytics or enrichment, see the Google Analytics Opt-out
  Browser Add-on.

- Apple iOS, Android OS, and Microsoft Windows each provide their own instructions on how to control in-app tailored advertising.
  For other devices and operating systems, you should review your privacy settings on that platform.

If you have any questions about your data, our use of it, or your rights, contact us at [isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com).

    limitation any data that has been (a) copied, stored, or disseminated by other users (including comments on content);
    (b) shared or disseminated by you or others (including in your shared content); or (c) posted to a third-party platform. Even
    after your account is terminated, we retain your data for as long as we have a legitimate purpose to do so (and in accordance
    with applicable law), including to assist with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain and
    disclose such data pursuant to this Privacy Policy after your account has been terminated.

- To request to access, correct, or delete your personal data, please submit these requests by
  emailing [isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com). Please allow up to 30 days for a response. For your protection, we may
  require that the request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to verify your identity
  before implementing your request. Please note that we retain certain data where we have a lawful basis to do so, including
  for mandatory record-keeping and to complete transactions.

### 6.3 Our Policy Concerning Children

We recognize the privacy interests of children and encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children’s
online activities and interests. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, but of the required age for consent to use online
services where they live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), may not set up an account, but may have a parent or
guardian open an account and help them access appropriate content. Individuals younger than the required age for consent to use
online services may not use the Services. If we learn that we’ve collected personal data from a child under those ages, we will
take reasonable steps to delete it.

Parents who believe that Udemy may have collected personal data from a child under those ages can submit a request that it be
removed to [isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com).

## 7. Jurisdiction-Specific Rules

If you live in California, you have certain rights related to accessing and deleting your data, as well as learning who we share
your data with. If you live in Australia, you have the right to make a formal complaint with the appropriate government agency.
Users outside of the United States should note that we transfer data to the UK and Poland. We reserve the right to send data
to other areas outside of the European Economic Area.

### 7.1 Users in California

Users who are California residents have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, (“CCPA”). If you are an eligible
California user, included in these rights are:

- **“Right to Know”** — You have the right to request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information
  that we have collected about you and access a copy of your personal information.

- **“Right to Correction”** — You have the right to have inaccurate personal information about you corrected.

- **“Right to Deletion”** — You have the right to request deletion of personal information that we have collected about you.

- **“Right to Non-Discrimination”** — If you choose to exercise any of your rights under CCPA, iSensei will treat you like all
  other users. In other words, there is no penalty for exercising your rights under CCPA.

- **“Right to Opt-Out”** - You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.

CCPA has a specific definition of a “sale” and while iSensei does not, in the traditional sense, sell your personal information
or the personal information of any of our users, we do use cookies that make non-personally identifiable information available
to select third-parties. To opt out of such a “sale,” contact our [Support](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com).

To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email [isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com). CCPA allows you
to designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. For your protection, we may require that the request be
sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to verify you and/or your agent’s identity before
fulfilling your request.

Additionally, for more information about the personal information we collect and how we collect it, please see the sections
above entitled “What Data We Get” and “How We Get Data About You.”

To learn about the business and commercial purposes for which your personal information is collected and the categories of service
providers who have access to your personal information, please see the sections above entitled “What We Use Your Data For”
and “Who We Share Your Data With.”

As a California resident, you also have the right to request certain details about what personal information we share with third
parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To submit your request, send an email to
[isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com) with the phrase “California Shine the Light” and include your mailing address,
state of residence, and email address.

Since there is no widely accepted standard for the browser-initiated Do Not Track signal, we do not currently recognize or
respond to Do Not Track signals.

### 7.2 Users in Nevada

**iSensei does not sell its users’ personal information or personal data.** Nonetheless, Nevada residents have the right to
submit a request that we do not sell your covered personal information, which you can
do by [isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com).

### 7.3 Users in Australia

If you are an Australia resident and you have a complaint, you may refer it to the office of the Australian Information
Commissioner (“OAIC”). You can contact OAIC by visiting [www.oaic.gov.au](www.oaic.gov.au); forwarding an email to
[enquiries@oaic.gov.au](enquiries@oaic.gov.au); telephoning 1300 363 992; or writing to OAIC at GPO Box 5218, Sydney NSW 2001.
You may contact our privacy team at [isensei.pl@gmail.com](mailto:isensei.pl@gmail.com) to make a complaint about a breach
of the Australian Privacy Principles which will be responded to within 30 days.

### 7.4 Users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and United Kingdom (“UK”)

If you are located in the EEA or UK, you have the right to request access to your data in a portable format and to request the
rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, or objection to processing of your personal data. You also have the right to

to submit your request. Additionally, if you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge
a complaint with your supervisory authority.

Personal data may also be processed outside of the UK, Switzerland, and the EEA by iSensei, or our service providers, including
to process transactions, facilitate payments, and provide support services as described in Section 4. We use the
Controller-to-Processor Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission to facilitate transfers of personal data
from the EEA to third countries and have entered into data processing agreements with our service providers and iSensei group
companies to restrict and regulate their processing of your data. By submitting your data or using our Services, you consent to this
transfer, storage, and processing by iSensei and its processors.

### 7.5 Users Outside of the U.S.

**In order to provide the Services to you, we must transfer your data to the UK, Poland and process it there.** If you are using
the Services from outside the EEA, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your data in and to the
EEA countries or other countries.
