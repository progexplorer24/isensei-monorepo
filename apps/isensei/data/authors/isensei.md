Hi, my name is Patrick and I am a founder of iSensei foundation where we try to promote open software & open education. You can find here **educational materials, tutorials and posts** where I share with you my learning adventures.

I created this blog to explore new ideas, share my knowledge and experiment with different technologies. If you enjoy learning and want to become better programmer - **sign up to our free newsletter**. Nice to meet you! 

I'm most experienced in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Right now, I'm mostly focused on **building full-stack web apps with React & Next.js**.

I am really passionate about learning new programming paradigms. Especially, I work hard on learning statically typed programming languages based on lambda calculus with great type-inference (checkout: [Convergence Algorithm Part 1](https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2016/04/inference-convergence/), [Convergence Algorithm Part 2](https://juliacomputing.com/blog/2017/05/inference-converage2/), [Hindley-Milner Type System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system)). In my work I often try to use languages like:  [Rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/) and [julia](https://julialang.org/). I still try to find new ways to grow as a developer. Nowadays, I'm slowly dipping my toes in languages like: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/).
