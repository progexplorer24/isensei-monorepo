Hey, I’m Lee. I'm a developer, writer, and the creator of Mastering Next.js and React 2025. I work at ▲Vercel as the Director of Developer Relations.

I’ve spoken across the country at conferences and meet-ups about front-end development, design, and recruiting. I write about development, tech careers, and my personal life on my newsletter.

I grew up in small-town Iowa and went to school at Iowa State, graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering. I spend my free time playing music, creating videos, and enjoying time with friends and family in Des Moines, IA.
