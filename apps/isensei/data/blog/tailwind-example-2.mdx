## Basic usage

### Setting the aspect ratio

Use the `aspect-{ratio}` utilities to set the desired aspect ratio of an element.

```html
<iframe
  class="aspect-video w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

Tailwind doesn't include a large set of aspect ratio values out of the box since it's easier to just use arbitrary values. See the [arbitrary values](#arbitrary-values) section for more information.

### Browser support

The `aspect-{ratio}` utilities use the native `aspect-ratio` CSS property, which was not supported in Safari until version 15. Until Safari 15 is popularized, Tailwind's [aspect-ratio](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-aspect-ratio) plugin is a good alternative.

## Applying conditionally

### Hover, focus, and other states

## Using custom values

### Customizing your theme

By default, Tailwind provides a minimal set of `aspect-ratio` utilities. You can customize these values by editing `theme.aspectRatio` or `theme.extend.aspectRatio` in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```diff-js tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
        aspectRatio: {
+         '4/3': '4 / 3',
        },
      }
    }
  }
```
